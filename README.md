### Hi !

Welcome to my GitHub profile ! My name is Fabio Gong-Omonte and I study @ McGill University pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science.

### About me 😄

Passionate about using programming to make my life easier, which is what lead me to create SetGen, an app that uses intricate algorithms to sort through a list of performances to generate setlists that give as many breaks to dancers. My interests include (but aren't limited to) gaming, kpop, dancing and a bit of chess ♟️
